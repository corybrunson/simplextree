\usage{
remove(simplex)
}
\arguments{
\item{simplex}{a k-length vector of vertex ids representing a (k-1)-simplex.}

\item{simplices}{a list of simplices.}
}
\description{
Removes simplices from the simplex tree. Individual simplices are specified as vectors, and a set of simplices as a list of vectors.
}
\details{
This function allows removal of a arbitrary order simplices. If \code{simplex} already exists in the tree, 
it is removed, otherwise the tree is not modified. \code{simplex} is sorted before traversing the trie.
Cofaces of \code{simplex} are also removed.
